## Gene expression data from the FinHER adjuvant breast cancer trial comparing microtubule targeting agents.

### Abstract

The Finland Herceptin (FinHER) trial is a phase III randomized adjuvant breast cancer trial comparing the microtubule-stabilizing agent Docetaxel with the destabilizing agent Vinorelbine. We describe here the data processing and quality control of microarray gene expression profiles derived using degraded RNA extracted from the FFPE archived patient samples of the FinHER trial. The dataset and data processing protocols may aid researchers in analyzing gene expression profiles from degraded RNA.
